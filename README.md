# ReactSchool-React--Intro
Project in Visual Studio Code
# Exercise
Write a mini information service, e.g. an application that has data in the form of an array of objects. You can store the data in the App component. 
Based on your data, iterate through the array items to display each individual article. If the intro is longer than 25 characters, then display the first 25 characters followed by 3 dots.
Then create a new component, e.g. BlogTile, that you will use to display each single entry in the iteration. Use styling in the application, but try to do it with JavaScript.
